all afflioted ehurches are surcto find “defence and security,
“a haven where no waves swell, and a treasure of
“blessings innumerable.''l The work of such a Synod
was not meant in the designs of God to be transient,
nor wcs its influence 1ο perish as soon as its immediate
objects were adnned3 but, rather, its spirit was long to
survive, 10 be to the Irish Church an abiding source of
vitality and strength in which, from time to time, her

· youth may be renewed cs of an eagle.

Gratefully acknowledging the benefits bestowed on ua
by God through the Synod of Thurles, in the National
synod which has just been happily completed at Maynooth,
we have prayed with theProphet, that He would once again
renew His own work: OLord J tby work, ia the midae os
years 10109 it to life.2 And i'n the regulations we have
made for the renovation of discipline, and for the promo-
tion of piety and morale, it has been our study to follow
as far as possible the lines traced in the decrees 01Ι Thurles,
so that, together united, the enactments of both Synods
might form one eompact code of ecclesiastioal law in
keeping with the requirements, and adequate to meet the
dangers of our time. In accordanoe with canonioal usage,
the results of our deliberatione shall not be made public
' until they shall have received the approbationes the
Roman Pontiff, to whom belongs “ the full and supreme
“power of jurisdiction over the entire Church, not merely
“ in things that appertain 10 faith and morale, but also in
“what concerns the discipline and government of the
“ Ghurch spread throughout the world.’'3

But, while awaiting this solemn sanction, without which
our Synodion] enaetments lach authority 10 bine, we feel
it incumbent on us to address to you, dearly beloved, on
this solemn occasion, words of congratulation and thanks-
