cannot but admire those heads of families‚ who, in obedi·
ence to the teaching of their Pastore, resisting the torrent
of evil custom, have closed their doors against these for·
bidden amusements, lest they should stain their conscience
by exposing themselves or others to the danger of spiri·
tual ruin. God is a faithful rewarder; and sueh parents
may rest assured that, as in the govemment of their house-
hold they have imitated the holy Tobias, who taught his
child from be's infeacy to feer (indeed obstate from every
sta,¹ sc, like him, they shall one day find joy and comfort
in the domestic happiness of the children they have brought
up so well, and through them be filled, even in this life,
with all good.

At no other time, perhaps, in the history of the Ohurch
have Catholios had more need of prudent energy than at
the present. The spectacle of Catholic progress galls our
enemies as sorely as the sight of the towers of Sion, rising
from their ruins under Esdras, galled the Gentiles around,
who, rebec they heard thet tlee wells ef Jerusalem were mede
ep, cred tlee breeelees begere to be closed, eeere eeeeedc'reply
erzyry: aad tleey all <resembled themselves tepether, to come,
aad tofiplct epeirest Jerusalem, aad to prepare ambeshes.
Aee tlte erreoee'es sold: let tieem rect know or renderstered,
. tell ree coare ie tlee laidet ef thern, aad lee'll them, aad cause
tlee ecerle to cessed- Wherefore also, we, who, like the
Jews, are engaged in again building up the Holy City of
(lod, like them, must defend, inch by inch, the sacred
fabric as it springs up beneath our hands. The more so
because our adversaries, like those of the Jews, affecta
warfare of mingled violence and craft. One distinguishing
characteristic of the policy that at present assails the
Ohurch is, that it deals its most deadly blovvs in the name

of eivfliaation, and in defense of authority.
