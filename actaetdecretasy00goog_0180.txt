Itis highly instructius to note the cause and progrees ct
¹²he striking change that 1100101011 place in this respect,
within the last twenty-five years. The authore 011110
²:evolutionary excesses 01 1848, imitating the example oi
their predecessore, assailed the Church by holding her up
t«) execration as the mainstay 01 the constituted authorities.
’1110 authors 01 the persecuting laws 01 the present day

secured by flooding the public mind, artfully prepared for
their reception, with travestiee 01 the Syllabue and of the
