would justily the suppression oi the Christian Religion
itself ; for· that religion is not areligion of mere sentiment,
bnt of positive doctrines and precepts, that must absolutely
clotho themselves in external acts. It belongs essentially
to the practieal order3 for it is the religion of a Redeemer,
