work it is to sap belief in the great primary truths, with·
out which society must break up and perish miserably.
Such truths are the existence of God and of the soul; the
moral distinction between right and wrong ; the sanctity
11 marriage ; the respect due to religion ; the duty 11 obe·
dience to parental authority. To establish a system 11
education which may be perverted into an organized attach
upon these truths‚ or upon any 11 thern, is inevitably to
