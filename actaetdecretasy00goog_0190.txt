Rs-wriring from this Oollege,wo should bo nngrsteful
to sn institution which has deserved well of successive gener-
ations of the Olergy and peopls of Ireland, were we to over·
look sn important and picus work which has just been
undertaken by its Trustees-the erectior osa Ohurch
adopted to its requirements, and worthy of the National
Gollege of the Irish Olergy. The plan for this College
Ohurch has been completed ; tho contractior its execution
has been entered into; and Sunday, 10th October, the
Feast of the Dedication of tho Ghurches of Ireland, has,
with much appropriateness, been fixed for laying the
foundations. The work will, of necessity, bc very costly‚
but it isone in which every Irish Catholic has an interest
almost directly personal. We earnestly commend it to
your picus generosity. We have authorized the President
to communicate with the Olcrgy of our several dioceses
with the view of organizing, in concert with esch, and ac·
cording to his convenience, parochial collectione, in aid of

the Buil‘ding Fund. The time in esch parish may be
regulnted by local circumstances3 hut March lvth, 1876,
the Feast of St. Patrick‚ tho Patron of tho College andos

the Church, is proposed as the most fitting occasion forthc
General Collection.
