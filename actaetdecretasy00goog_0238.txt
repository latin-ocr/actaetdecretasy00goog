I, , son (daughter) of ,of the age
of years, on my knees before you, Most Reverend
Father ‚ of the order of Friars Preachers, Master
in holy Theology, and Oommissioner-Genersl of the
HolyRoman and Universa] Inquisition, having before my
eyes the Holy Gospels which Ι touch with my hands, and
knoving that no one can be saved without that saith
which the Holy catholic Apostolic Roman Ohurch holds,
believes, and boschos, against which I grieve that Ι have
greatly erred, inasmuch as, born ol parents who were out
of the said Ghurch, Ι have held and believed doctrines
opposed to her teaching.

Ι now, with grief and contrition, profess that I believe
the Holy catholic Apostolic Roman Church Ιο be the only
and t'rue Ohurch established on earth by Jnsvs Cnmsv,
to which Ι submit myseli with my whole heart. Ibelieve
all the articles that She proposes to my belief, and I reject - ’
and condemn all that She rejects and condemns, and I
sm ready to observe allt ttha She commanda me, and
especially I proiesst that I believe: -

One only God m Three Divina Persons, d1st1nct from ’
