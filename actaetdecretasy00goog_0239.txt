Death, and Remunotion ol our Lord Jnsos euersa and
the Hypostatio Union of the two Natures, the divino aud.
the human; the Divine Maternity ol the Most HolyMary,
together with her most epotless Virginity.

The true, real, and substantial presenoe ot the Body,
together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jusus
Ouarsa in the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist.

The seven Sacraments instituted by Jnsus Gmusr for
the salvation of mankind, that is to say-Raptim, Gon·
firmatim, Eucharist Penanoe, Extreme Unction, Order,
Matrimony.

Purgatory, the Resurrection of the Dead, Everlasting
Life.

The Primaey, not only of honour, but also of jurisdic-
tion of the Roman Pontiff, successor of St. Peter, Prinos
of the Apostles, Vicar ol Jnsns (lumen.

The veneration of Saints and oi their imagee.

The authority of the Apostolio and Ecclesiastioal Tra·
ditione, and of the Holy Scriptures, which we must inter-
pret and understand only in the sense which our Holy
Mother the Catholio (lhuroh has held and holds.

And everything else that hasbeen defined and deelared
by the saored Canens and by the General Counoils, espe-
cially by the Holy Gonnoil of Trent.

With a sineere heart therefore, and with unfeigned
belief,1detest and abjuro every error, heresy‚ and seot
opposed to the said Holy Catholio and Apostolio Roman
Ghurch. So help me God, and these his holy Gospels
which Ι touch with my hands.

I, ,as aforesaid, have with my own hand

signed this aot of my sineere conversion, and return into
the bosom of the same Ghuroh, whieh I have reoited word
for word.

This day ol
